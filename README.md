A student management system (software) project is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based Python script and executable that allows the administrator to enter student data into a database and export the data to a CSV file. In this project, I utilised Tkinter for the graphical user interface, PyMySQL for database and query creation, PIL for picture loading, Pandas to convert the data to a CSV file, time to define the time, and date and as well as ttkthemes for the button themes.
